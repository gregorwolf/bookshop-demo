# Bookshop Sample App

Sample application showcasing different services serving the same set of data entities from a sqlite database. 
The services match different use cases visualized in corresponding Fiori apps.

## Develop in VS Code devcontainer
The easiest way to get started with devlopment of this project is inside a Docker Devcontainer. See [this blog post](https://github.com/htammen/cap-vscode-dev-container#so-what-do-i-have-to-do) for details.   
If you don't have Docker installed **you can of course develop within you local OS**. But in that case you have to install all your tools and vs extensions on your own.

## Preliminaries

* get [_Node.js_](https://nodejs.org/en/) v12 or higher
* get [_sqlite_](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) (Windows only; pre-installed on Mac/Linux)
* As SAP has deprecated their own NPM registry please remove the setting in your npm config with the following command

```sh
npm config rm @sap:registry
```

## Setup

Copy & paste this to your command line:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gregorwolf/bookshop-demo.git
cd bookshop
npm install
npm run setup
```

## Run local

```sh
npm run build
npm start
```

## Deploy to SAP Cloud Platform - Cloud Foundry Environment

We're using the mbt build to create a mtar that can be deployed to the SAP CP Cloud Foundry. The cf commandline must be installed and you have to be logged on to the space you want to deploy to. The build ist started with:

```
npm run build:cf
```

then you can deploy with:

```
npm run deploy:cf
```

## Deploy to SAP HANA XSA on Premise

We're using the mbt build to create a mtar that can be deployed to the SAP HANA. The xs commandline must be installed and you have to be logged on to the space you want to deploy to. The build ist started with:

```
npm run build:xsa
```

then you can deploy with:

```
npm run deploy:xsa
```

## Allow embedding as an iFrame

Manuel Seeger described the needed steps in [Can't authenticate against HTML-Mashup embedded SCP application in C4C](https://answers.sap.com/questions/13014707/cant-authenticate-against-html-mashup-embedded-scp.html). Here are the concrete steps for this application:

```sh
cf create-service xsuaa apiaccess bookshop-access
cf create-service-key bookshop-access bookshop-access-sk
cf service-key bookshop-access bookshop-access-sk
```

Store the returned values as Key-Value Pairs in tests/.env. I.e.: 

```
apiurl="https://api.authentication.us10.hana.ondemand.com"
```

Also add a variable for appurl which represents the app you want to enable to be embedded in an iFrame. Then run the REST Client Script tests/configure-xsuaa.http.

## Allow API Access

[Carlos Roggan](https://people.sap.com/carlos.roggan) providedes a great description in his SAP Community blogpost: [How to call protected app from external app as external user with scope](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/06/02/how-to-call-protected-app-from-external-app-as-external-user-with-scope/). For the moment we will not use a separate client app but a REST client script. Follow the next steps to get it working for this project. Start of by creating a separate xsuaa service instance by running:

```sh
cf create-service xsuaa application xsuaaforclient -c tests/xs-security.json
```

Then create and display a service key for this xsuaa:

```sh
cf create-service-key xsuaaforclient xsuaaforclient-sk
cf service-key xsuaaforclient xsuaaforclient-sk
```

Store the returned values as Key-Value Pairs for clientid, clientsecret, url in tests/.env. as:

```
clientid="sb-xsappforclientapp!dsjdfs"
clientsecret="NbFeh8ibk2zQ="
url="https://<your-trial-account>trial.authentication.eu10.hana.ondemand.com"
srvurl="https://<your-trial-account>trial-dev-bookshop-demo-srv.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com"
```

Then open the REST Client script *tests/api-access.http* in VS Code and run the script with the comment *Get Access Token (Cloud Foundry)*. It should return a valid access_token. Now execute the requests *Read Orders* and *Read Books*. You should see a valid result.
